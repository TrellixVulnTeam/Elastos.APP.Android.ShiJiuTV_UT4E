This is a slightly advanced version of Xvfb from xorg-server
1.9.3.901

This version was built from the 1.9.3.901 sources at freedesktop.org.

It was compiled using a random flavour of ubuntu Lucid according to the
recipes in the building subdirectory in order to produce a statically linked
version that would work on the host machines, since many of the libraries
are present, but incompatably earlier versions.
